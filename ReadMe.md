## Matrix Screen Commander x16

A BASIC v2 program for the Commander x16 (r31) that (very slowly) generates the Matrix Screen thing.
The emulator can be found here at https://github.com/commanderx16/x16-emulator
Can load this with (loads it via 'typing' it into the emulator)
	$ ./x16emu -bas matrix.bas
Note: This is in ASCII, and can't be loaded directly from within the emulator because the BASIC interpreter expects a tokenized BASIC PETSCII program.
